// DLL users:
// - Heaps and globals are not shared across DLL boundaries!
// - You will need to call SetCurrentContext() + SetAllocatorFunctions() for each static/DLL boundary you are calling from.
// - Same applies for hot-reloading mechanisms that are reliant on reloading DLL (note that many hot-reloading mechanisms work without DLL).
// - Using Dear ImGui via a shared library is not recommended, because of function call overhead and because we don't guarantee backward nor forward ABI compatibility.
// - Confused? In a debugger: add GImGui to your watch window and notice how its value changes depending on your current location (which DLL boundary you are in).

// Current context pointer. Implicitly used by all Dear ImGui functions. Always assumed to be != NULL.
// - ImGui::CreateContext() will automatically set this pointer if it is NULL.
//   Change to a different context by calling ImGui::SetCurrentContext().
// - Important: Dear ImGui functions are not thread-safe because of this pointer.
//   If you want thread-safety to allow N threads to access N different contexts:
//   - Change this variable to use thread local storage so each thread can refer to a different context, in your imconfig.h:
//         struct ImGuiContext;
//         extern thread_local ImGuiContext* MyImGuiTLS;
//         #define GImGui MyImGuiTLS
//     And then define MyImGuiTLS in one of your cpp files. Note that thread_local is a C++11 keyword, earlier C++ uses compiler-specific keyword.
//   - Future development aims to make this context pointer explicit to all calls. Also read https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/586
//   - If you need a finite number of contexts, you may compile and use multiple instances of the ImGui code from a different namespace.
// - DLL users: read comments above.
